# counterfit-lightsensor-led
Light sensor with LED signal (sent through MQTT) using CounterFit - Fake IoT Hardware | Python 3.9.13

Refer to [Microsoft IoT For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started/lessons/4-connect-internet)

# TL;DR
There are 2 folders:
- [Client](https://github.com/keira-n/counterfit-lightsensor-led/tree/main/nightlight_thing_whatever/nightlight) is for sending telemetry from the IoT device (CounterFit) to the MQTT broker and receiving commands.
- [Server](https://github.com/keira-n/counterfit-lightsensor-led/tree/main/nightlight_thing_whatever/nightlight_server) is for receiving telemetry from the MQTT broker and sending commands back.

## Running order: CounterFit > Client = Server
### CounterFit
1. Create a terminal

2. Activate the virtual environment 
`> .venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Launch CounterFit
`> counterfit`

4. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/

5. Create a light sensor

### Client (nightlight)
1. Create a new terminal

2. Activate the virtual environment
`> .venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Run the python app
`> py app.py`

### Open a new a new VSCode window for the Server (Easier to navigate)
1. Create a new terminal

2. Activate the virtual environment
`> .venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Run the python app
`> py app.py`

## What it should look like now
